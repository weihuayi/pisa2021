# 评估创造性思维

## 为什么要评估创造性思维?

Creative insights and advances have driven forward human culture across the world
in diverse areas (Hennessey and Amabile, 2010 [1] ): in the sciences, technology, philosophy,
the arts and humanities. Creative thinking is thus more than simply coming up with random
ideas. It is a tangible competence, grounded in knowledge and practice, that supports
individuals in achieving better outcomes, oftentimes in constrained and challenging
environments. Organisations and societies around the world increasingly depend on
innovation and knowledge creation to address emerging challenges (OECD, 2010 [2] ),
giving urgency to innovation and creative thinking as collective enterprises.

创造性直觉与进步驱动世界范围人类文化在各个领域向前发展, 包括科学, 技术, 哲学,
艺术和人文. 创造性思维不是简单来自于随机的观念和想法, 它是一种有形的能力, 根植
于知识和实践, 支持个人在受限和充满挑战的环境下, 取得更好的成就. 世界各地的组织和
社会团体为应对出现的各种挑战, 越来越依赖创新和知识创造, 迫切需要创新和创造性思
维.


While it is true that creative thinking drives the types of innovation that
have a society-wide impact, it is also a more universal and democratic
phenomenon than one might first believe. That is to say that every individual,
to a greater or smaller degree, has the potential to think creatively (OECD,
2017 [3] ). Furthermore, there is a general consensus among psychologists and
educators alike that creative thinking, understood as engagement in the
thinking processes associated with creative work, can improve a host of other
individual abilities, including metacognitive capacities, inter- and
intra-personal and problem-solving skills, as well as promoting identity
development, academic achievement, future career success and social engagement
(Beghetto, 2010 [4] ; Plucker, Beghetto and Dow, 2004 [5] ; Smith and Smith,
2010 [6] ; Torrance, 1959 [7] ; National Advisory Committee on Creative and
Cultural Education, 1999 [8] ; Spencer and Lucas, 2018 [9] ; Long and Plucker,
2015 [10] ; Barbot, Lubart and Besançon, 2016 [11] ; Barbot and Heuser, 2017
[12] ; Gajda, Karwowski and Beghetto, 2017 [13] ) (Higgins et al., 2005 [14] ).


就是说, 每个个体或多或少都有创造性思考的潜能. 此外, 在心理学家和教育者之间有一
个普遍共识, 创造性思维可以改进很多其它的个人能力, 包括元认知能力, 人际及个人的
问题解决能力, 促进个性发展, 学业成就, 未来的职业成功, 及社会参与能力.


Developing an international assessment of creative thinking can encourage positive
changes in education policies and pedagogies. The PISA 2021 creative thinking assessment
will provide policymakers with valid, reliable and actionable measurement tools that will
help them to make evidence-based decisions. The results will also encourage a wider
societal debate on both the importance and methods of supporting this crucial competence
through education. This work in PISA is connected to another OECD project that aims at
supporting new pedagogies that can foster creative thinking. For the past years, the OECD’s
Centre for Educational Research and Innovation (CERI) has been leading an eleven-
country study on ways of teaching and assessing creative and critical thinking with
encouraging early results 1 .


开发一个创造性思维的国际评估框架, 可以鼓励教育政策和教育学做出积极的改变. PISA
2021 创造性思维评估将为政策制定者提供一个有效, 可靠及可操作的测量工具, 帮助他们
做出基于证据的决定. 评估框架也会鼓励社会对支持这个关键能力融入教育的重要性和方
法进行广泛的讨论. PISA 这项工作与另外一个 OECD 的支持可以培育创造性思维的教育学
相联系. 在过去的数年中, 经合组织的教育研究与创新中心已经领导了 11 个国家, 研究
教学及评估创造性与批判性思维的方法, 得到了不少鼓舞人心结果.
